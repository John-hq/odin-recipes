    <h1>Recipe</h1>

    <p>These tasty Philly cheese steak sliders are quick and easy to make. Great for a busy weeknight or game day.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) beef skirt steak, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian bread rolls</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>8 slices pepper Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak, onion, and bell pepper; cook and stir until steak is browned and cooked to your liking and onions are tender, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Slice the connected rolls in half widthwise to look like 2 giant slices of bread. Place the bottom half into the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Spread mayonnaise evenly on top.</li>
        <li>Place 4 slices of pepper Jack cheese over mayonnaise. Layer steak mixture and remaining cheese on top. Cover with the top half of the bread. Spread melted butter on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread is browned, about 20 minutes. Slice into individual portions.</li>
    </ol>
